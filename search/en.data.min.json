We have used them as daily driver for a few weeks. Almost all of the app required to create an account for every member which is inconvenient. Some of them lack basic features like Discussion, Notifications, etc. that we deem essential. In short, none of them satisfied our need.\nThat is why we launched our own meal management app on Google Play titled Meal Manager - Track Meals on a Shared Flat that is both functional and as simple as possible. No need to create an account for every member but the manager. Also, members can update quantity of meals, request guest meals, and leave a public message from anywhere without physically contacting the manager. The manager will get notifications within the app to take actions accordingly.\nIt is a hobby project and the app is available for free with no ads. Any suggestions to improve the quality of this app is more than welcome.
