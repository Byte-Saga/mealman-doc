We have used them as daily driver for a few weeks. Almost all of the app required to create an account for every member which is inconvenient. Some of them lack basic features like Discussion, Notifications, etc. that we deem essential. In short, none of them satisfied our need.
That is why we launched our own meal management app on Google Play titled Meal Manager - Track Meals on a Shared Flat that is both functional and as simple as possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
