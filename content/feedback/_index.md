Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Byte-Saga/mealman-doc/issues/new/choose) on our GitHub repository if you find any inconsistency or if anything is missing from the documentation.

If you encounter any crash while using our app, `Crash Report Tool` will automatically pop up asking to report the event. Help us squash the bugs and make **Meal Manager** app better for everyone.

You may also email us directly to 'iaminul237@gmail.com' if you do not have a GitHub account. In that case, do not forget to keep _Meal Manager App - Feedback_ as email 'Subject'.
