Every member will be notified about the announcement immediately after opening the `Meal Manager` app next time.
Members may view the announcement any time later by tapping on `Announcement` on the the `Home` page.
Previous announcements can also be viewed by tapping on `Announcement` followed by `See Announcement History`.
