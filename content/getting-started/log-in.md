If you have just installed our app, it is time for a new experience.
After opening the app for the first time, it will show you `Log In` screen with the following options:

1. Are you a Manager?

   If you are a manager, choose the `Yes` button beside the text that says `Are you a manager?`.
   It will take you to the next screen where you will be asked to input your `Username` and `Password`.
   Fill in your account details and then tap on `Log In`.

2. Are you a Member?

   If you are a `Member`, you do not need an account.
   You can `Log In` with manager's `Username`.
   In that case, choose the `Yes` button beside the text that says `Are you a member?`.
   It will take you to the next screen where you will be asked to input your manager's `Username`.

3. New Here?

   If you are new here and you are a manager, choose the `Create Account` button beside the text that says `New here? (Manager Only)`.
   It will take you to the next screen where you will be asked to input your `Username` and `Password` for your new account.

   Tap on `Continue` to proceed with the account creation process.
   After that, you will be asked to provide your `Phone Number` for verification.
   A verification code will be sent to your phone number.
   Your account will be created shortly after submitting the verification code.

4. Recover Password

   Do not worry in case you have forgotten your password.
   Relax! You can still access your account.
   Just scroll down to the bottom of the `Log In` screen and then go to `Recover Password`.
   Input your `Username` to continue the password recovery process.
   On the next screen, provide the `Phone Number` you used for opening the account in question and then tap on `Submit`.
   A verification code will be sent to you shortly.
   After submitting the verification code, you will be prompted to choose your new password.
   Choose a simple but strong password so that you can remember it in future and then tap on `Reset`.
   On the following screen, you will see a message stating that your password will be changed if your phone number matches with the database.

   {{< hint type=note >}}
   It may take some time for the new password to take effect.
   If it is taking too long, you may attempt to reset your password again.
