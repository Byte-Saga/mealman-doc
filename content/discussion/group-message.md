`Group Message` is handy for communicating with the manager and other members.
Like `Bazaar Routine` and `Bazaar Report`, `Group Message` is also accessible under `Discussion` menu.
Any member can post a message via this option for others to see.
Tap on `Compose Message`, input your name on the box that says `Enter Your Name`, type your message on the box below and then tap on `Send`.
That's it!
Every member will receive your message the next time they open the app.
